# Mars Climate Orbiter Solution
 This code addresses issues related to readability, calculation errors, and robustness. Error handling mechanisms have been implemented to ensure that incorrect parameter types or units of measurement trigger error messages.

 ## Changes Made :
 1. Descriptive variable names were used for code clarity.
 2. There is proper indentation and formatting for better  readability.
 3. Corrected a calculation error in the calculation of new velocity. The velocity is now correctly converted from meters per seconf to kilometers per hour.
 4. Robust error handling mechanisims to prevent silent failures was implemented.
 5. Validation checks were added to ensure that all input parameters are the correct type(numbers).
